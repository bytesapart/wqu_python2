Mini Project IV - Readme
========================
Python Version: 2.7

Author: Osama Iqbal

Date: 8th October, 2017

Description
----------------
This Python program takes a csv (in the same folder) called 'presidents.csv' that contains all the
presidents since 1921 (since it loads data from 1920, and the NaN row is dropped when yearly returns
are calculated) and get's their descriptive statistics. It then plots it in a barplot for comparison.
The main objective of this exercise is as follows:
* To check during which ruling party's year was the stock market more bullish.
* Representing the findings in an intuitive graphical format to easily comprehend.

Platforms
----------------
This application is platform agnostic. This program was created using Anaconda2 v4.4.0. However, this should
work on any standard installations of python 2.7.x+. The program was developed on a flavour of Ubuntu 16.04 (elementary OS 0.4.1 Loki)
with Kernel version as Linux 4.10.0-33-generic. The code tends to be
cross-platform, however this has not been tested on a Windows or Mac
machine.
