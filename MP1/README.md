## README

1. This program was created using Anaconda2 v4.4.0. However, this should
work on any standard installations of python 2.7.x+
2. To install the packages required to run the program, please find the
requirements.txt file. This file contains all the packages used by the
program. To install, do the following:

    **pip install -r requirements.txt**
3. The program was developed on a flavour of Ubuntu 16.04 (elementary OS 0.4.1 Loki)
with Kernel version as Linux 4.10.0-33-generic. The code tends to be
cross-platform, however this has not been tested on a Windows or Mac
machine.

4. The program is launched by typing the following on the command line:

   **python OsamaIqbal_MiniProject1.py**

5. Accepts standard SnP500 Tickers. Other tickers for countries haven't been tried.
If they would work, they would have to be prefixed with their Stock Exchange. Please refer to
Yahoo Finance for more details
